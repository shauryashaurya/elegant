* Functional programming basics - concrete examples and no BS    
* Creating a proof checker from scratch - to grok how this stuff works    
* Exploring Coq and a bunch of other functional programming languages

The following is a *very sketchy* early stages outline, which is likely to evolve as I move forward:
  
  
## Proof Checking   
  
Formal systems, inference rules, axioms, the concept of syntactic proof vs. semantic proof, and the difference between proof checking and proof search.  
  
## Representing Mathematical Statements   
  
Formal languages, syntax trees (or abstract syntax trees—ASTs), logical symbols, variables, and how to parse them in code.  
  
## Inference Rules and Proof Systems   
  
Natural Deduction (or another simple proof system), derivation trees, premises vs. conclusion, checking validity step-by-step.  
    
## Designing a Simple Proof Checker in Python   
  
Data structures (for statements and proofs), Python implementations of inference checks, handling typical rules like “modus ponens,” “introduction and elimination rules,” etc.  
  
## Extending the Proof Checker to Handle More Complex Logic  
   
Handling quantifiers (∀ and ∃), equality, or other logical connectives beyond - ∧, ∨, →, ¬.  
    
## Grok Coq   
    
Overview of the Coq environment, the Calculus of Inductive Constructions (CIC), the “tactics” approach in Coq, and differences from our handcrafted checker.  
    
## Implementing a Minimal Checker in Coq   
     
Step-by-step coding of a minimal formal system in Coq, verifying correctness, and how to run proofs within Coq.  
     
## MOAR   
   
Proof automation, advanced type theories, big players in theorem proving (Isabelle, Lean, Agda), and how they compare.
